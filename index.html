<p>Heyy Manvitha!!</p>

<br>

<p>Before anything, in case you are wondering what above timer is? Its the time since you were born (This is why I have asked your time of birth long time back :) )</p>

<p>I know I might be bothering you, and I’m sorry for that. But I couldn’t keep these feelings to myself any longer—I wanted to express them to you. I like you, and it’s more than just a crush. I won’t claim to know exactly what love feels like, but I do know that you’ve become someone very special to me.</p>

<p>It’s not just about how beautiful you are. I admire so many things about you—the way you cherish your family, how you stay dedicated to your work instead of wasting time on social media, your presence, your smile, your talent, and the way you carry yourself. These are the things that make you truly special to me. I even found myself checking our horoscope, wondering if fate had a say in this. That’s how much I think about you, and that’s entirely on me.</p>

<p>I understand that too much persistence can sometimes feel overwhelming. I don’t want to make you uncomfortable, and I don’t want to force anything. But if you’re open to it, I’d love for us to take a small step forward—just to get to know each other better. I don’t know if you’re already in a relationship or if you like someone else. If that’s the case, please tell me. I don’t want to hold expectations where there’s no possibility.</p>

<p>But if there’s even the slightest chance, I’d love the opportunity for us to spend some time together and see where it leads. I’ve had regrets in life—times when I didn’t express my feelings and lost people who meant a lot to me. I don’t want to make that mistake again. That’s why I’m telling you this now.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, we all find someone. But in my heart, I feel like that someone could be you. And I wouldn’t have come this far if I didn’t believe in that possibility. That said, I respect your feelings. If you’re certain that there is absolutely no chance for us, just let me know. I’ll accept it and move on with clarity.</p>

<p>But if there’s even the smallest possibility of having me in your life, I’d love to get to know you better and see where this journey takes us. No matter what you decide, thank you for reading this. I just needed to say it.</p>
